## What is NumPy?

NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. NumPy is the foundation for many other data science and machine learning libraries in Python.

## Why Use NumPy?

- Efficient array operations
- Mathematical functions for linear algebra, Fourier analysis, etc.
- Tools for integrating with C/C++ and Fortran code
- ...and much more!

## Getting Started

To get started with NumPy, make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can install NumPy using:


pip install numpy


## Notebooks

## What are NumPy Slice Operations?

NumPy slice operations allow you to efficiently extract, modify, and manipulate portions of arrays. Slicing is a fundamental aspect of NumPy that enables users to work with subsets of data without the need for explicit loops.

## Getting Started

To get started with NumPy and slice operations, make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can install NumPy using:


pip install numpy
